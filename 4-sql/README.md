Now that you have your schema, create a real live database with the tables!

**1) Create a database file:**

```bash
$ touch imdb.sqlite3
$ sqlite3 imdb.sqlite3
```

**2) Write the `CREATE TABLE` statements to build the tables with their columns.**

Print out the schema from within the console, and copy-paste it's structure into your gist.


**3) Populate the database with some test data of your choosing and test some queries.**

Copy and paste your queries and their results into a `.sql` file and add it to your repo.

If your database isn't quite working the way you expect, write out your SQL statements and explain what they **should** be returning so you can explain your process during review.
