# Errors and Debugging

## Introduction

Software has bugs (surprise, surprise). By now you should be familiar with errors in Ruby and how to use them to debug your code. This problem will give you a chance to demonstrate your proficiency with debugging.

## Your Mission

In this challenge, you'll find some code. The code, however, is currently non-functional. That is, it has errors. You need to find and fix three errors to get the code to work.

To run the code: `ruby driver.rb`

1. Find the error.
2. Fix it.
3. Repeat (find the next error).


#### NOTES
1. If you're working on your laptop, make sure you've installed the nokogiri gem: `gem install nokogiri`

2. Debugging the first two errors should be fairly straight-forward. The third error may be less obvious. Be sure to use all your debugging skills:

* stack trace
* `puts` statements
* google
* etc.

**If you get stuck, put up a sticky!**
