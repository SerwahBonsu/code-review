For this problem, you'll be designing a database schema for the basic imdb application you coded in part 2. You can use [SQL designer](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/sql).

Be sure to think through how many tables you need, what the attributes should be, and how they relate. This should all be obvious from the code that you wrote in part 2.

To submit:
 * Take a screenshot of your schema and add it to your repository.
