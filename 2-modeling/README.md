### Basic IMDB clone (imdb.com)

For this problem, you'll model and create the classes that will support an application similar to imdb.com.  Your task is to determine what classes you need, their structure, and how they should be implemented.

When you're done, the tests in the spec file should pass.

**Note**: In addition to implementation, there are two tests currently marked `pending` in `imdb_clone_spec.rb`. You'll need to write those yourself.
